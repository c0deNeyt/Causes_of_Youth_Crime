                    <p>The major contributing factors to juvenile crimes include peer pressure,
                    poor education, poor socioeconomic status, substance abuse, and neglectful 
                    parents. Let's have a look at each of these factors to understand how they
                    affect the teens and how they can be curtailed.</p>

                            <h2>What is youth crime?</h2>
                            <p>Due to the high rates of crime committed by most young people, youth crime has become a
                            major global concern. As a result, action must be taken to either reduce or completely avoid
                            child engagement in criminal activity. Juvenile delinquency, another name for adolescent
                            criminality, refers to behavior that is unusual for young people given cultural or even legal
                            expectations. There are many factors that are considered to facilitate indulgence in crime by
                            the youths for instance poor up bringing, poverty and unemployment, lack of education and
                            peer pressure among others. This research paper will look into the various aspects that are
                            associated with youth crime for example the causes, the delinquent behaviors involved, and
                            the preventive measures undertaken to handle the delinquencies.</p>

                                <h2>Broken Family</h2>
                                <p>A teen adopts moral and ethical values from his parents and other family members.
                                It goes without saying that family plays a vital role in shaping a teen’s behavior and
                                grooming his/her personality. However, teens become violent or show signs of juvenile
                                delinquency only when they’re facing disturbance at home. Broken or disturbed families
                                with bad relations can cause teens to go astray and become violent. Single parents are
                                often busy working, therefore they’re not able to spend quality time with their children.
                                This causes teens to seek attention from others, especially their peers.</p>

                                <h2>Lack of Communication</h2>
                                <p>Often lack of discourse in the family can lead children to find solace other than homes. When they are not having any communication with their parents or family members at home, they may lose unity, trust, and understanding, which can eventually lower their self-esteem or self-confidence. Once they feel they’re losing their individuality, they tend to do things they shouldn’t do to boost their self-confidence. They blindly follow their peers and adopt their unhealthy lifestyles. They shoplift and consume drugs to look cool in the eyes of their peers.</p>

                                <p>Young or adult, may lead to a wrong path to improve their financial conditions. Teens become juvenile delinquents due to lack of finances. When they experience poor economic conditions, they start engaging in the wrong activities. They may start selling drugs or steal things to improve their economic conditions.</p>

                                <p>Teens who have not given any social or moral training often lead to juvenile delinquency. It is the parent’s duty to teach moral and ethical values to their children. They should teach them the difference between right and wrong behavior. Lack of social and moral values can lead children to poor interaction with others and make them less confident. They may become selfish and arrogant. They would not know how to respect the laws of the state. Parents often neglect their children and pay more focus on working hard to earn money for them. However, while doing so, they forget the importance of spending quality time with their children. In their absence, children tend to spend time with someone who pays attention to them. They may also fall into wrong hands or get involved in a bad company while seeking attention from someone other than their parents.</p>
